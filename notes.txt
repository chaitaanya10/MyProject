## DevOps Basics:

1. Git is used for version control.

   * Commands: `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`, `git branch`, `git merge`
   * Local Repo vs Remote Repo

2. GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket are remote repositories.

   * Store code centrally
   * Collaborate with teams
   * Example command: `git remote add origin <repo_url>`

3. CI/CD automates build, test, deploy.

   * Tools: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI
   * Pipeline stages: Source → Build → Test → Deploy → Monitor

4. Docker is used for containerization.

   * Package app + dependencies into containers
   * Commands: `docker build`, `docker run`, `docker ps`

5. Kubernetes is used for orchestration.

   * Manage multiple containers
   * Handles scaling, load balancing, self-healing
   * Components: Pods, Services, Deployments

6. Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

   * Tools: Terraform, Ansible, CloudFormation
   * Automates provisioning of infrastructure

7. Monitoring & Logging.

   * Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
   * Ensures application health and performance

8. Cloud Platforms.

   * AWS, Azure, GCP
   * Provide infrastructure, managed services, scalability
